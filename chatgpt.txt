code for position absolute relative static fixed  with border and better viewing and understandability

Here’s an example of how to use position: absolute, relative, static, and fixed in CSS with borders, providing a clear view of how each works. This example uses div elements with different positions to help visualize the behavior.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <style>
        /* Body and page setup */
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            height: 2000px; /* Make the page scrollable for better visualization */
            background-color: #f4f4f4;
        }

        /* Common styles for all divs */
        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 150px;
            border: 2px solid #333;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px;
            background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.3);
            text-align: center;
            font-size: 16px;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }

        /* Static Positioning */
        .static-box {
            position: static;
            background-color: lightgreen;
        }

        /* Relative Positioning */
        .relative-box {
            position: relative;
            top: 50px; /* Moves the box 50px down */
            left: 50px; /* Moves the box 50px to the right */
            background-color: lightblue;
        }

        /* Absolute Positioning */
        .absolute-box {
            position: absolute;
            top: 150px; /* Positioned 150px from the top of the nearest positioned ancestor */
            left: 150px; /* Positioned 150px from the left of the nearest positioned ancestor */
            background-color: lightcoral;
        }

        /* Fixed Positioning */
        .fixed-box {
            position: fixed;
            top: 20px; /* 20px from the top of the viewport */
            left: 20px; /* 20px from the left of the viewport */
            background-color: lightyellow;
        }

        /* Container to visualize relative positioning */
        .container {
            position: relative;
            margin: 50px;
            padding: 20px;
            border: 2px dashed #333;
            height: 500px; /* Container height to visualize absolute positioning */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <div class="static-box box">
        <h3>Static Position</h3>
        <p>Default position. It flows with the page content.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relative-box box">
        <h3>Relative Position</h3>
        <p>Moved 50px from the top and left of its original position.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="absolute-box box">
            <h3>Absolute Position</h3>
            <p>Positioned 150px from the top and left of the nearest positioned ancestor.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="fixed-box box">
        <h3>Fixed Position</h3>
        <p>Stays fixed at 20px from the top and left of the viewport even when scrolling.</p>
    </div>

</body>
</html>

Explanation of each positioning type:

    position: static (Default behavior):
        The .static-box is positioned according to the normal document flow. It does not have any offset and will appear where it would naturally fall in the page layout.

    position: relative:
        The .relative-box is positioned relative to its normal position. Here, it's moved 50px down and 50px to the right from its original position in the document flow.

    position: absolute:
        The .absolute-box is positioned absolutely with respect to its nearest positioned ancestor. In this case, that’s the .container div, which has position: relative. It is positioned 150px from the top and left of the .container.

    position: fixed:
        The .fixed-box is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window) and stays in place even when you scroll down the page. It remains at 20px from the top and left of the viewport.

Viewing and Understandability:

    Static will flow with the page and doesn’t have offsets.
    Relative shifts from its original location without affecting other elements.
    Absolute can move freely inside a container (or the whole document if no parent has position other than static).
    Fixed will remain fixed in the viewport and doesn't scroll with the page content.
